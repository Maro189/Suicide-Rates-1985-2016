# Suicide-Rates-1985-2016
Data Project about worldwide suicide rates from 1985-2016
This is another personal data project to add to my portfolio
The raw data source was taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016
The data file was downloaded to my personal computer then imported into jupyter notebooks via python packages.
Data was then cleaned up for organisation.
Lastly, data visulisation was made via tableau
